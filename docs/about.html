            <p><a href="index.html">MRR Triangle</a> is a tool to help understand feeds and speeds and their affect on material removal rate.  This is heavily inspired by the Harvey Performance Company Youtube video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb3Jdek1aM8&t=460s">Solving End Mill Failures: Mastering the MRR Triangle LIVE With The Cutting Tool Counselor</a>.  This video demonstrates a spreadsheet and this page is my attempt to make something similar available on the web.</p>

            <h1>Using it</h1>
            <p>Start by filling out the top row, the tool diameter, the SFM, the flutes and the inches per tooth (IPT).  It defaults to inches in decimal format (e.g '.5' is interpreted as 1/2 inch) but you can enter fractions or metric values (.e.g '1/2' or '12.7 mm') if like.</p>
            <p>Once you have filled out the top row, an Inches per Minute (IPM) will be calculated below, as well a revolutions per minute (RPM).  If you then fill out the radialand axial values, a Material Removal Rate (MRR) will be caculated.
